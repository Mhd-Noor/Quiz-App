# üß† Trivia Triumph: Interactive Quiz App

## üéÆ Inspiration
As a first-year computer science student, I wanted to create an engaging way to reinforce my learning while also having fun. I decided to develop a quiz app that not only tests knowledge across various topics but also incorporates an interactive user experience. After thorough research and planning, I built this app to challenge players and enhance their trivia skills. Below is the documentation of my journey.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
This Interactive Quiz App is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring key elements that create a dynamic quiz experience:

1. **Game Structure**: The app fetches quiz questions from the Open Trivia Database API, ensuring a wide variety of trivia questions.

2. **User Interface**: The app presents questions and answer choices using a responsive design, allowing for an intuitive gameplay experience. The user can select answers with visual feedback indicating correct or incorrect choices.

3. **Progress Tracking**: The app keeps track of the player's progress through the quiz, displaying the current question number and the overall score.

4. **Local Storage**: Player scores are saved in local storage, allowing users to view high scores and track their performance over time.

5. **Dynamic Question Loading**: Questions are randomly selected, ensuring a unique experience each time the user plays.
